# Project-_Decoder_ring-Adama_Walters-Solution

## Description
This is a project where we enable 3 functionalities:
1. Caesar cipher (alphabet letters are shifted by a certain value)
2. Polybius function (alphabet letters map to numbers specified on a grid, the column and row)
3. Substitution cypher (user provides an alphabet and input is translated to new alphabet based on that alphabet)

## Learnings
- We needed to think of the logic behind these functions to implement the ciphering and deciphering functionality
- We needed to write tests and utilize test driven development (write tests first) to ensure our solutions passed

## Items to focus on in the future
- Logic practice - do similar exercises
- Minimizing code repetition
- Using nyc library to view test coverage
